linuxCheating
=============

Just a cheat sheet so I dont have to be technical assistance, and for things I can never remember.

This is a good cheatsheet for [markdown language](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet):

Things to add:

* How to copy with rsync over SSH so interrupted uploads/downloads can be continued
* Writing Cron jobs
* SSH Tunnelling
* Using Putty
